# Cooking Addon Gmod 
It's a basic cooking addon that I made for Garry's Mod that takes a entity which is "Dough" and cooks it into bread.

## File Structure
<your_addon_name>/lua/entities/jet_stove

<your_addon_name>/lua/entities/jet_stove_dough

place inside the addon folder in Gmod. 

## Where to find the entities.
Spawn Menu > Entities tab > Jet Pack (Entities) or Jet Pack (Food), unless you modified the shared.lua files then it'll probably be either in (Other) or whatever you defined for it.

## I'm a beginner.
So don't @ me for help or tips or anything, and don't @ me because it's terrible.
